<think>Let's analyze the new issue. The container is running but the webserver isn't showing. This could be due to several reasons:

1. Port mapping issues
2. The Dagster webserver not starting correctly
3. Network configuration issues
4. Permissions issues

Let's check a few things:

1. First, let's confirm the port mapping in the docker-compose.yml file looks correct.
2. Check if there might be any logs indicating what's happening.
3. Consider if we need to adjust the entrypoint or the way Dagster is being started.

From the provided files, I see:

```yaml
# From docker-compose.yml
services:
  audio-transcripter:
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"  # Dagster UI
    volumes:
      - dagster-data:/opt/dagster/dagster_home
      - ./dagster_audio:/app/dagster_audio  # For development hot-reload
```

And from the Dockerfile:

```dockerfile
ENTRYPOINT ["dagster", "dev", "-p", "3000"]
```

The port mapping looks correct (3000:3000), but there might be an issue with how Dagster is starting. 

Let me think about possible solutions:
1. We might need to adjust how the webserver is being started
2. There could be permissions issues with the volumes
3. The Dagster configuration might need adjustment

I'll suggest a few changes to try:</think># Dagster Webserver Not Showing Issue

If your container is up but the webserver isn't showing, there are a few potential issues and solutions we should try:

## 1. Check for Errors in Container Logs

First, check the container logs to see if there are any error messages:

```bash
docker-compose logs
```

Look for any errors or warnings that might indicate why the webserver isn't starting.

## 2. Try Explicitly Starting the Webserver

Modify your Dockerfile's entrypoint to explicitly start the Dagster webserver:

```dockerfile:Dockerfile
# Change this line
ENTRYPOINT ["dagster-webserver", "-h", "0.0.0.0", "-p", "3000"]
```

This directly starts the webserver component rather than using the `dagster dev` command.

## 3. Check Network Configuration

Ensure your container is exposing the port correctly. In your docker-compose.yml:

```yaml:docker-compose.yml
services:
  audio-transcripter:
    # ... other configuration ...
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"  # Dagster UI
    # Add this to make sure it binds to all interfaces
    environment:
      - DAGSTER_HOME=/opt/dagster/dagster_home
      - PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1
      - DAGSTER_WEBSERVER_HOST=0.0.0.0
```

The `DAGSTER_WEBSERVER_HOST=0.0.0.0` environment variable makes sure the webserver binds to all network interfaces.

## 4. Try Running the Daemon and Webserver Separately

A more robust approach is to run both the daemon and webserver:

```dockerfile:Dockerfile
# Use a script to start both services
COPY start.sh /app/start.sh
RUN chmod +x /app/start.sh
ENTRYPOINT ["/app/start.sh"]
```

Then create a new file:

```bash:start.sh
#!/bin/bash
# Start the daemon in the background
dagster-daemon run &

# Start the webserver in the foreground
exec dagster-webserver -h 0.0.0.0 -p 3000
```

## 5. Verify Storage Permissions

Make sure the container has proper permissions to write to the storage directory:

```dockerfile:Dockerfile
# Before the entrypoint
RUN mkdir -p /opt/dagster/dagster_home
RUN chmod 777 -R /opt/dagster/dagster_home
```

The simplest solution is likely option #2 - directly using the `dagster-webserver` command. This bypasses any complexity with the `dagster dev` command that might be causing issues.
